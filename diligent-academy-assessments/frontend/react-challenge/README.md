# React challenge

Create a React component for listing heroes.

## Principles and rules

- You can create as many files as you need.

# Tasks

1. Use the given async function in `call-api.ts` to acquire a list of heroes and render them into a list.
   Heroes have ids, names and wether they are available. If a hero is available, print “Available“.


2. Create a separate component for hero list items.


3. Show a "Loading" message while we are fetching the heroes. If the fetch fails, show an error message like "Failed to fetch heroes.


4. Style the components to look similar to this image:
   ![img.png](img.png)
   **The exact colors, paddings, margins, etc. are not important, but the general layout should be similar.**


5. Create a custom hook for wrapping the fetch functionality.
